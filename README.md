## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit342/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose
